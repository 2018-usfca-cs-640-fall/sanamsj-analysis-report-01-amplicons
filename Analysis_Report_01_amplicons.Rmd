# Introduction

Add about 1.5-2 pages here. Must cite at least 5 peer reviewed articles.

# Methods

## Sample origin and sequencing

Add about half a page here. In this section instead of first person (I/we), use Fierer et al., since you'll just be describing what they did, based on the methods in their paper.

## Computational

These are the methods you used. Should probably be at least a half of a page. At a very minimum should include citations for DADA2 [@callahan2016] and phyloseq [@mcmurdie2013]. Note that these don't count towards the five references you need to cite in the introduction.

# Results

In addition to a minimum of 3-4 figures/tables (and associated captions), you should include sufficient text in this section to describe what your findings were. Remember that in the results section you just describe what you found, but you don't interpret it - that happens in the discussion.

```{r load-libraries, message = FALSE}
# Be sure to install these packages before running this script
# They can be installed either with the intall.packages() function
# or with the 'Packages' pane in RStudio

# load general-use packages
library("dplyr")
library("tidyr")
library("knitr")
library("ggplot2")

# this package allows for the easy inclusion of literature citations in our Rmd
# more info here: https://github.com/crsh/citr
# and here:
# http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html
library("citr")

# These are the primary packages well use to clean and analyze the data
# this package needs to be installed from bioconductor -- it's not on CRAN
# see info here: https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/dada-installation.html
library("dada2")

# This to export a fasta of our final denoised sequence variants
library("seqinr")

# To install this you have to install from GitHub
# See more info here: https://github.com/leffj/mctoolsr
# run this -- install.packages("devtools")
# and then this -- devtools::install_github("leffj/mctoolsr")
library("mctoolsr")

# And this to visualize our results
# it also needs to be installed from bioconductor
library("phyloseq")
```

```{r extract-sample-and-file-names}
# NOTE: Much of the following follows the DADA2 tutorials available here:
# https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html
# Accessed October 19, 2017

# set the base path for our input data files
path <- "data/raw_data"

# Sort ensures samples are in order
filenames_forward_reads <- sort(list.files(path, pattern = ".fastq"))

# Extract sample names, assuming filenames have format: SAMPLENAME.fastq
sample_names <- sapply(strsplit(filenames_forward_reads, "\\."), `[`, 1)

# Specify the full path to each of the filenames_forward_reads
filenames_forward_reads <- file.path(path, filenames_forward_reads)
```

```{r check-quality-plots}
# Plots the quality profiles of all the first twenty samples
plotQualityProfile(filenames_forward_reads[1:20])
```

We can see from the quality profiles that most reads tend to get pretty bad in quality after around 200 bases. 

```{r filter-reads}
# Place filtered files in filtered/ subdirectory
# note this will fail if the directory doesn't exist
filter_path <- file.path("output", "filtered")
filtered_reads_path <- file.path(filter_path,
                                 paste0(sample_names,
                                        "_filt.fastq.gz"))

# See ?filterAndTrim for details on the parameters

filtered_output <- filterAndTrim(fwd = filenames_forward_reads,
                                 filt = filtered_reads_path,
                                 maxLen = 300,
                                 maxN = 0, # discard any seqs with Ns
                                 maxEE = 3, # allow w/ up to 3 expected errors
                                 truncQ = 2, # cut off if quality gets this low
                                 rm.phix = TRUE,
                                 compress = TRUE,
                                 multithread = TRUE)
```

```{r filtered-read-counts-table}
# produce nicely-formatted markdown table of read counts
# before/after trimming
kable(filtered_output,
      col.names = c("Reads In",
                    "Reads Out"))
```

```{r learn-errors}
# this build error models from each of the samples
errors_forward_reads <- learnErrors(filtered_reads_path,
                                    multithread = FALSE)
```

```{r visualize-errors-with-plots}
# quick check to see if error models match data
# (black lines match black points) and are generally decresing left to right
plotErrors(errors_forward_reads,
           nominalQ = TRUE)
```

```{r dereplicate-sequences}
# get rid of any duplicated sequences
dereplicated_forward_reads <- derepFastq(filtered_reads_path,
                                         verbose = TRUE)

# Name the derep-class objects by the sample names
names(dereplicated_forward_reads) <- sample_names
```

```{r run-dada}
# parameters adjusted based on recommendations for 454 data here:
# https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/
#     faq.html#can-i-use-dada2-with-my-454-or-ion-torrent-data
dada_forward_reads <- dada(dereplicated_forward_reads,
                           err = errors_forward_reads,
                           HOMOPOLYMER_GAP_PENALTY = -1, # reduce penalty bc 454
                           BAND_SIZE = 32) # performs local alignments bc indels

# check dada results
dada_forward_reads
```

```{r make-sequence-table}
# produce the 'site by species matrix'
sequence_table <- makeSequenceTable(dada_forward_reads)
```

The output table has `r nrow(sequence_table)` rows (samples) and `r ncol(sequence_table)` columns (sequence variants). Notice how we can embed R code directly in our markdown text.

```{r histogram-of-sequence-lengths}
# Quick check to look at distribution of trimmed and denoised sequences
hist(nchar(getSequences(sequence_table)),
     main = "Histogram of final sequence variant lengths",
     xlab = "Sequence length in bp")
```

```{r remove-chimeras}
# Check for and remove chimeras
sequence_table_nochim <- removeBimeraDenovo(sequence_table,
                                            method = "consensus",
                                            multithread = FALSE,
                                            verbose = TRUE)

# What percent of our reads are non-chimeric?
non_chimeric_reads <- round(sum(sequence_table_nochim) / sum(sequence_table),
                            digits = 4) * 100
```

After removing chimeras, we were left with `r non_chimeric_reads`% of our cleaned reads.

```{r table-of-pipeline-read-counts}

get_n <- function(x) sum(getUniques(x)) # make a quick function

               sapply(dada_forward_reads, get_n),
               rowSums(sequence_table),
               rowSums(sequence_table_nochim))

# add nice meaningful column names
colnames(track) <- c("Input",
                     "Filtered",
                     "Denoised",
                     "Sequence Table",
                     "Non-chimeric")

# set the proper rownames
rownames(track) <- sample_names

# produce nice markdown table of progress through the pipeline
kable(track)
```

```{r assign-taxonomy}
# assigns taxonomy to each sequence variant based on a supplied training set
# made up of known sequences
taxa <- assignTaxonomy(sequence_table_nochim,
                       "data/training/rdp_train_set_16.fa.gz",
                       multithread = TRUE,
                       tryRC = TRUE) # also check with seq reverse compliments

# show the results of the taxonomy assignment
# unname(taxa); #
```

```{r extract-sequences-to-fasta}

# so that we can build a phylogeny - we'll build the phylogeny outside of R
# but we need the fasta file to do so. We keep the names of each sequence as the

# it's columns (e.g. 'species')
# function taken from https://github.com/benjjneb/dada2/issues/88
export_taxa_table_and_seqs <- function(sequence_table_nochim,

**Figure 1**: Histogram that describes the abundance of sequences in both females and males.

 Most of the sequences were from males and only few females were in this project.


```{r table-contains-sources-of-sequences-in-both-genders}
table(factor(metadata_in$sample_source) , factor (metadata_in$Sex))

```

**Figure 2**: Table that describes the sources of the sequences in both genders.

Most of the sequences were from males samples and only 3 females samples were 
swabbed from spacebar key.

```

**Figure3** Diversity of differenet phyla in both genders colored by class.

This graph shows that most of the bacteria were from Actinobactria and Firmicutes classes.

```

**Figure4**: Histogram that shows the diversity of bacteria on females samples.

This histogram shows that most of the bacteria were from Actinobacteria,
Bacilli and Chloroplast classes.
